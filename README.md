# 🧠 Marketing Campaign Analysis & Customer Segmentation (Power BI + Python)

This project explores a marketing campaign dataset using Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), customer segmentation (RFM + K-Means), and creates a professional dashboard in Power BI.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Dataset: [Kaggle – Marketing Campaign Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)
- Tools: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Power BI
- Focus:
  - Data cleaning & feature engineering
  - Demographic & behavioral analysis
  - Campaign response analysis
  - RFM and K-Means clustering
  - Visual dashboard in Power BI

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed (Python)
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed unrealistic ages, fixed marital statuses, grouped education levels
- **Demographic Analysis**: Age groups, marital status, education
- **Behavioral Insights**: Spending patterns across product categories
- **Campaign Performance**: Analyzed response by age, education, and income
- **Segmentation**:
  - **RFM Analysis**: Scored customers based on Recency, Frequency, Monetary value
  - **K-Means Clustering**: 4 clusters for behavioral segmentation

## 🙋 About Me

I’m actively transitioning into data analytics from automotive engineering, with a strong focus on Python and business intelligence tools like Power BI. This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate real-world data exploration and dashboard creation.

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Add machine learning prediction model (e.g., campaign success)
- Use SHAP for explainability
- Connect live Power BI to data pipeline (SQL/Cloud)
